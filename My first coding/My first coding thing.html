<p>My name is Bella and I am a Whippet. 
    If you do not know what a Whippet is I will tell you 
    (even if you already know I will tell you anyway).</p>

<p>A Whippet is a dog who looks like a Greyhound 
    (but a bit smaller and way more cute), runs really 
    fast and like to sleep for about 80% of the time. </p>

<h4>Here are a couple of things that I like to do:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Sleep a little</li>
    <li>Run</li>
    <li>Sleep some more</li>
    <li>Cuddle</li>
    <li>Sleep again</li>
</ol>

<p> Of course, there are a lot of other things you should know about me.
    I am 5, almost 6 years old. I was born in Eksjo in Smaland. 
    My top speed is 60 km/h and I weigh about 13 kg.
    I whine really badly when I do not get the attention that 
    I think that I deserve (which is quite often) and I tend to 
    ruin my parents made-up bed. Also, I really like rabbits and rats 
    (to chase, not to cuddle with).</p>
